# Cuppa
Cuppa is a dark theme for Visual Studio Code, brewed with love and designed to be easy on the eyes.

It is still a work in progress, with research being done (which colours go with which, etc.) and as of the time of writing, the only way to install cuppa is through cloning the project into your `C:/<USERNAME>/.vscode/extensions` folder.

Once Cuppa reaches a state of development considered usable and complete-ish it will be attempted to be uploaded to Visual Studio Code's theme explorer.

> Cuppa is inspired by gruvbox, and possibilities of a theme for vim and emacs exist.
